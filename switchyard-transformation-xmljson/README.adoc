== Using Camel XmlJson Extension in SwitchYard

:numbered:

== Overview

This project provides a sample application and the steps required for adding camel-xmljson data format library to an existing SwitchYard runtime on EAP.

== Project Structure

This project consists of a single Switchyard composite application, with a Camel Service interface and a File binding. The file listener is set up to listen to the folder ‘_/etc/input_’. A sample input file ‘_input.txt_’ (consisting of comma separated values) is included. 

The camel-xmljson extension is bundled in * xmljson.zip*.

== Execution Environment

=== Adding the Extension to SwitchYard sub-component

To use the camel-xmljson library, this library needs to be added as a module extension in EAP, and also to the switchyard sub-component in switchyard. This can be achieved via the following steps:

. Unzip *xmljson.zip* in the _$FSW_HOME/modules/system/layers/soa/org/apache/camel_ folder. A new folder ‘xmljson’ will be created which consists of the _main/module.xml_ and the associated camel-xmljson jar file. 
. Open the configuration file used for the FSW install e.g _$FSW_HOME/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml_. Search for the ’switchyard’ sub-component and add the following line to the _<extensions>_ section:
<extension identifier="org.apache.camel.xmljson”/>
. Restart the Application Server instance to ensure the module extensions are updated.

=== Deploying the SwitchYard application

To test the application, first build the project using ‘_mvn clean install_’, and then deploy to the Application Server (either through the JBDS server configuration or using the administration console.

Then, copy the test input file ‘input.txt’ to the ‘_/etc/input/_’ folder. 
In the Server logs, the input and output text should be displayed correctly.
