== Using Camel XStream Extension in SwitchYard

:numbered:

== Overview

This project provides a sample application and the steps required for adding camel-bindy data format library to an existing SwitchYard runtime on EAP.

== Project Structure

This project consists of a single Switchyard composite application, with a Camel Service interface and a File binding. The file listener is set up to listen to the folder ‘_/tmp/input_’. A sample input file ‘_input.txt_’ (consisting of comma separated values) is included. 

The camel transformation first unmarshals CSV data to a Java object and then uses XStream to marshal the java object to a XML file.

The camel-bindy extension from the ‘switchyard-transformation-bindy’ is used. In addition,
the camel-xstream extension is bundled in *xstream.zip*.

== Execution Environment

=== Adding the Extension to SwitchYard sub-component

To use the camel-xstream library, this library needs to be added as a module extension in EAP, and also to the switchyard sub-component in switchyard. This can be achieved via the following steps:

. Unzip * xstream.zip* in the _$FSW_HOME/modules/system/layers/soa/org/apache/camel_ folder. A new folder ‘xstream’ will be created which consists of the _main/module.xml_ and the associated camel-xstream jar file. 
. Open the configuration file used for the FSW install e.g _$FSW_HOME/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml_. Search for the ’switchyard’ sub-component and add the following line to the _<extensions>_ section: +
`<extension identifier="org.apache.camel.xstream”/>`
. Restart the Application Server instance to ensure the module extensions are updated.


[NOTE]
===============================
*NOTE* Due to a link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1168909[bug] in the xstream libraries shipped with FSW, the com.thoughtworks.xstream module needs to be changed, by adding the ‘_xmlpull-1.1.3.1.jar_’ to the resource library.

Add the jar file (included here) in the ‘_$FSW_HOME/modules/system/layers/soa/com/thoughtworks/xstream_’, and add the following line to the module.xml:+
`<resource-root path="xmlpull-1.1.3.1.jar"/>`

===============================

=== Deploying the SwitchYard application

To test the application, first build the project using ‘_mvn clean install_’, and then deploy to the Application Server (either through the JBDS server configuration or using the administration console.

Then, copy the test input file ‘input.txt’ to the ‘_/tmp/input/_’ folder. 
In the Server logs, the input and output text should be displayed correctly.
